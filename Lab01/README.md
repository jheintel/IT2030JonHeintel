<h1> Lab 1 Heintel </h1>

I would like to create a computer and IT accessory retail site for this class. 
It's probably not the most unique but it does sound fun.

I will call it:

<b>Johnny Nexus IO</b>

JNIO is a one stop shop for PC internal parts and other computing accessories. The application will showcase a selection of
different PC parts and allow for collection of choices into a shopping cart. There shuld be a membership with login info and
some way to compare parts to other similar parts. Maybe even a model setup feature that allows for seeing all the parts
assigned to their roles to assure nothing is looked over. All these and more emply promises at Johnny Nexus IO.

Disclaimer: we do not sell stolen classified soviet era chips and boards behind the dumpster on the first Thursday of the
month.
